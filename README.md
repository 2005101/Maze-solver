# Maze solver

This repository contains a Java program that simulates a robot navigating through mazes using various algorithms. The project explores both manual and automatic maze-solving techniques, showcasing concepts like pathfinding, backtracking, and recursive exploration.

## Features:

1. Manual Maze Runner: Allows users to manually guide the robot through the maze by specifying directions (N, S, E, W).
2. Automatic Maze Runner: Implements logic to navigate the robot automatically through the maze using conditional checks and movement priorities.
3. Pathfinding with Backtracking: Uses a stack to track the robot's moves, enabling backtracking when it encounters dead ends.
